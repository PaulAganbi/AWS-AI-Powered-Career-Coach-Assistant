# AWS-AI-Powered-Career-Coach-Assistant

This repository contains my implementation of an AI-driven Career Coach Assistant built using Amazon Q Business. The application analyzes CVs and job profiles to identify skill gaps and recommend targeted training resources. It demonstrates my practical experience with cloud-based data integration, access control, and generative AI applications.

## Project Summary

I designed and configured an Amazon Q application with the following core capabilities:

## Core Functionality

Implemented input cards for uploading CVs and job profiles.

Built output cards for skill gap analysis and personalized training recommendations.

Validated all components using sample data and interface testing.

## Advanced Features

Added a personalized training schedule via a dedicated output card.

Included an input card for coach-based recommendation requests.

Verified the functionality of both advanced components.

## Data Integration

Uploaded and synced a static PDF course catalog.

Created an Amazon S3 bucket and integrated it as a dynamic data source.

Confirmed successful synchronization for both sources.

## Automation and Security

Configured daily scheduled sync for the S3 data source to maintain data freshness.

Applied an ACL file to enforce controlled access for CareerCoaches group users.

Documented access success and denial scenarios.

Added content moderation rules to block restricted keywords.

## Publishing

Shared the final application with designated users and groups.

Applied custom labels and completed the endorsement process.

Published the application as a Verified Q App.
